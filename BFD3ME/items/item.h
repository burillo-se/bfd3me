 * This is another contraption that i had to come with to support
 * two different methods of saving stuff.
 *
 * Basically, when a user sets a variable, two things may happen:
 * - if the "saveToElement" is "true", changes will be passed along to the
 *   QDomElement responsible for the element
 * - if it is "false", then user will have to call "save" to actually save
 *   the changes to XML.
 *
 * Being the contraption it is, all of this is up to subclasses to implement.
